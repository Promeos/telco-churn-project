## Planning
---
 - [ ] Goal(s)
     - [ ] Find drivers of customer churn
     - [ ] Accurately predict customer churn at Telco.
 - [ ] Measure(s) of success
     - [ ] Hypothesis testing
     - [ ] Baseline accuracy
     - [ ] 3 classification models
         - [ ] Model performance: train, validate, test
         - [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
 - [ ] Plan to achieve 1 & 2
 - [ ] Develop hypotheses

 ## Acquisition
--------------
- [ ] Instructions to acquire data
- [x] Upload `.csv` file to repository - file named `telecom_data.csv`
